1) choose a PDE and generate data

2) build "library", i.e. the features that supposedly build up our unknown PDE
this includes some choice of representation

3) regression magic

4) compare results


NOTES:

time dependent parameter to tune the system to make it go between a lorenz and a rossler

bayesian inference -> sparsity assumption has limits -> confidence levels

prior -> library construction and sparsity assumption
